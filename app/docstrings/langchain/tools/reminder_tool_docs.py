"""Docstrings for reminder-related LangChain tools."""

CREATE_REMINDER = """
Create a new reminder (static or agent-based) for the user.

This tool schedules reminders that can either:
1. **STATIC** â€” fire a plain notification at a specific time (no LLM involvement).
2. **AI_AGENT** â€” wake the LLM (you) at a specific time to perform a task using available tools.

Use this tool only if you are confident that you (the agent) or the system can act on the reminder at runtime.

---

### ðŸ”¥ Reminder Types:

**STATIC Reminders**:
- Send a predefined notification (title + body).
- Use when the reminder is simple and doesn't require reasoning or access to tools.
- Payload must be of type `StaticReminderPayload`.

**AI_AGENT Reminders**:
- Triggers the LLM to take action at the scheduled time.
- You must write clear `instructions` that tell the agent exactly what to do.
- You are responsible for checking whether the required tools are available before creating an AI_AGENT reminder.
- Payload must be of type `AIAgentReminderPayload`.

---

### ðŸ§  Example: AI_AGENT Reminder Flow

User says:  
**"Remind me at 9PM every day to summarize my unread emails."**

Step-by-step:
1. Check: Do you have tools to access and summarize emails?
2. If yes, set `repeat = "0 21 * * *"` (daily at 9PM).
3. Use the following `AIAgentReminderPayload`:

```json
{
  "instructions": "The user wants a daily summary of unread emails. Fetch all unread emails at 9PM and summarize them in plain English. Output JSON: { 'title': ..., 'body': ... }"
}
````

If no tools are available for email access â†’ do not create the reminder, and politely refuse the request.

---

### ðŸ§˜ Example: STATIC Reminder

User says:
**"Remind me to meditate at 7AM tomorrow."**

â†’ Create a one-time static reminder using:

```json
{
  "title": "Time to Meditate",
  "body": "Breathe deeply and take 10 minutes for yourself."
}
```

---

### Args

- **agent**  
  static or ai_agent reminder type.

  - `"0 */2 * * *"` â†’ every 2 hours  
  - `"30 18 * * 1-5"` â†’ weekdays at 6:30PM  

- **scheduled_at** *(optional)*  
  ISO 8601 formatted datetime when the reminder should first run. If repeat is set, no need to specify this.

  Maximum number of times the reminder will fire.

- **stop_after** *(optional)*

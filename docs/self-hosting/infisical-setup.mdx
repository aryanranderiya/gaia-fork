---

## Overview

Infisical is a secure secret management platform that GAIA uses to centrally manage environment variables and API keys. Instead of storing sensitive information in `.env` files, Infisical allows you to:

- **Centrally manage secrets** across multiple environments
- **Secure access controls** with role-based permissions  
- **Audit logging** for secret access and changes
- **Automatic secret rotation** capabilities
- **Team collaboration** with shared secret access

<Note>
When Infisical is configured, it will **override any local environment variables** with the same names from your Infisical project.
</Note>

## How Infisical Works with GAIA

GAIA's backend automatically loads secrets from Infisical during startup using the `inject_infisical_secrets()` function. Here's the process:

1. **Authentication**: Uses machine identity credentials to authenticate with Infisical
2. **Secret Retrieval**: Fetches all secrets from your Infisical project
3. **Environment Injection**: Overwrites local environment variables with Infisical secrets
4. **Application Startup**: GAIA starts with the combined environment configuration

## Setting Up Infisical

### Step 1: Create an Infisical Account

1. Visit [app.infisical.com](https://app.infisical.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project for GAIA

### Step 2: Create a Machine Identity

Machine identities allow GAIA to authenticate with Infisical automatically:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Access Control** → **Machine Identities**
2. Click **Create Identity**
3. Configure the identity:
   - **Name**: `gaia-backend`
   - **Role**: Admin or Developer (with read access to secrets)
4. Note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 3: Add Secrets to Infisical

Navigate to your project's **Secrets** section and add all your environment variables:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Core Application">
    ```bash
    ENV=production
    DEBUG=false
    HOST=https://api.heygaia.io
    FRONTEND_URL=https://heygaia.io
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Database URLs">
    ```bash
    POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
    MONGO_DB=mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/gaia
    REDIS_URL=redis://user:pass@host:6379
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI API Keys">
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
    HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your-hf-token
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integration APIs">
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
    BING_API_KEY=your-bing-key
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 4: Configure GAIA Backend

Add the Infisical configuration to your backend `.env` file:

```bash
# Infisical Configuration
INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-from-infisical
INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# Optional: Set environment (defaults to 'production')
ENV=development
```

<Warning>
The `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`, `INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` must be set in your local `.env` file - they cannot be stored in Infisical itself since they're needed to authenticate with Infisical.
</Warning>

## Environment Priority

GAIA loads environment variables in this order (later sources override earlier ones):

1. **System environment variables**
2. **Local `.env` file variables**  
3. **Infisical secrets** (highest priority)

This means:
- ✅ Infisical secrets will override local `.env` variables
- ✅ You can use local `.env` for development and Infisical for production
- ✅ Critical secrets are managed centrally through Infisical

## Development vs Production

### Development Setup

For local development, you can choose between:

**Option A: Use Infisical** (Recommended for teams)
```bash
# backend/.env
ENV=development
INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID=your-dev-project-id
INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

**Option B: Use Local Environment Variables**
```bash
# backend/.env
ENV=development
# Add all your environment variables here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-local-dev-key
# ... other variables
```

### Production Setup

For production, **always use Infisical**:

```bash
# backend/.env (production)
ENV=production
INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID=your-prod-project-id
INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=your-prod-client-id
INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-prod-client-secret
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="InfisicalConfigError: INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID is missing">
    **Solution**: Add the `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID` to your `.env` file. You can find this in your Infisical project settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication failed">
    **Solution**: 
    - Verify your `INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_INDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - Ensure the machine identity has proper permissions
    - Check that the identity is enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secrets not loading">
    **Solution**:
    - Verify the environment slug matches (development/production)
    - Check that secrets exist in the correct Infisical project
    - Ensure the machine identity has read access to secrets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local variables not being overridden">
    **Solution**: This is expected behavior. Infisical secrets have the highest priority and will override local variables with the same name.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Debug Mode

To debug Infisical integration, check the application logs during startup. The backend will log any Infisical connection issues.

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access Control">
    - Use separate machine identities for different environments
    - Grant minimal required permissions
    - Regularly audit access logs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secret Management">
    - Use different secrets for dev/staging/production
    - Rotate secrets regularly
    - Never commit Infisical credentials to version control
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Separation">
    - Use separate Infisical projects for each environment
    - Implement proper CI/CD secret injection
    - Monitor secret access patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backup Strategy">
    - Export secrets regularly for backup
    - Document secret recovery procedures
    - Have fallback authentication methods
  </Card>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="docker" title="Docker & Docker Compose">
    - Docker Desktop or Docker Engine (v20.10+)
    - Docker Compose (v2.0+)
    - At least 4GB of available RAM
    - 10GB of free disk space
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Development Tools">
    - Git (for version control)
    - Python 3.11+ (for backend development)
    - Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
    - pnpm (for frontend package management)
    - uv (for Python package management)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="System Requirements">

## Development Environment Setup

To start developing on GAIA, you need to set up your local environment. You can choose between an automated setup using our script or a manual setup.

    The easiest way to get started. Our script handles everything for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Setup" icon="wrench" href="#manual-setup">
    For those who want more control over the setup process.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Automated Setup

We provide a script that automates the entire setup process. This is the recommended method for most users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the Setup Script">
    Open your terminal and run the following command from the project root:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup.sh
    ```

    This script will:
    - Start the required services with Docker Compose.
    - Create a Python virtual environment.
    - Install backend dependencies with `uv`.
    - Install frontend dependencies with `pnpm`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You're Ready!">
    Once the script finishes, your development environment is ready to go!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up your environment manually, follow these steps.

### Environment Variables

Before you start the services, you need to configure your environment variables. GAIA uses `.env` files to manage these settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Example Files">
    We provide example files to get you started. Copy them to create your own `.env` files:

    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Your Secrets">
    Edit the newly created `.env` files and fill in your API keys and other secrets.

    For a detailed explanation of all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Docker Services">
    GAIA relies on several services that run in Docker containers. Start them with Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Virtual Environment">
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Backend Dependencies">
    We use `uv` for fast dependency management. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Frontend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Frontend Directory">
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Frontend Dependencies">
    We use `pnpm` for managing frontend packages. Install them with:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Root Directory">
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

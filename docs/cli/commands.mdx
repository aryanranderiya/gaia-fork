## Overview

The GAIA CLI provides commands for setup, running, logs, health checks, and shutdown.

```bash
gaia init          # Full setup from scratch
gaia setup         # Configure existing repo
gaia start         # Start self-host services
gaia dev           # Developer mode (Nx TUI)
gaia dev full      # Developer mode + workers (Nx TUI)
gaia logs          # Stream logs
gaia stop          # Stop services
gaia status        # Check service health
gaia --version     # Show CLI version
gaia --help        # Show all commands
```

## All Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gaia init` | Full setup from scratch — clone repo, configure env, and initialize services |
| `gaia setup` | Configure an existing repository |
| `gaia start` | Start GAIA services in self-host mode |
| `gaia dev` | Run developer mode in Nx TUI (`mise dev`) |
| `gaia dev full` | Run developer mode + workers in Nx TUI (`mise dev:full`) |
| `gaia logs` | Stream logs for currently running services |
| `gaia stop` | Stop running GAIA services |
| `gaia status` | Check health and latency of GAIA services |
| `gaia --version` | Display the current CLI version |
| `gaia --help` | Show help and available commands |

---

## `gaia init`

Complete first-time setup.

```bash
gaia init
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--branch <name>` | Clone a specific branch |

```bash
gaia init --branch develop
```

The wizard walks through:

1. Prerequisites (Git and Docker; Mise only for developer mode)
2. Port conflict checks and alternatives
3. Repository setup
4. Environment setup (manual or Infisical)
5. Project setup

---

## `gaia setup`

Configure an existing GAIA repository.

```bash
cd /path/to/gaia
gaia setup
```

Use this when you need to reconfigure environment variables, change setup mode, or refresh setup.

---

## `gaia start`

Start GAIA services in **self-host mode**.

```bash
gaia start
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--build` | Rebuild Docker images before starting |
| `--pull` | Pull latest base images before starting |

`gaia start --build --pull`

<Note>
In developer mode, use `gaia dev` or `gaia dev full` instead of `gaia start`.
</Note>

---

## `gaia dev`

Run developer mode in Nx TUI (foreground).

```bash
gaia dev
```

Equivalent underlying command: `mise dev`

## `gaia dev full`

Run developer mode + workers in Nx TUI (foreground).

```bash
gaia dev full
```

Equivalent underlying command: `mise dev:full`

---

## `gaia logs`

Stream logs for currently running services.

```bash
gaia logs
```

- Self-host mode: streams Docker service logs.
- Developer mode: streams Docker logs and, when available, app logs.

---

## `gaia stop`

Stop running GAIA services.

```bash
gaia stop
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force-ports` | Aggressively stop listeners on API/Web ports (may affect non-GAIA processes) |

```bash
gaia stop --force-ports
```

By default, `gaia stop` runs in safe mode and only targets GAIA-managed processes.

---

## `gaia status`

Check health and latency of GAIA services.

```bash
gaia status
```

---

## Port Conflict Handling

If required ports are in use, the CLI:

1. Detects the conflicting process
2. Suggests alternative ports
3. Writes overrides to `infra/docker/.env`

Overrides persist across restarts and are reused by `gaia start`, `gaia logs`, and `gaia status`.

---

## Upgrading

### Updating GAIA

```bash
cd /path/to/gaia
git pull
gaia setup
```

### Updating the CLI

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g @heygaia/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g @heygaia/cli
```

```bash bun
bun add -g @heygaia/cli
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Uninstalling

1. Stop all services: `gaia stop`
2. Delete the repository directory
3. Remove CLI metadata: `rm -rf ~/.gaia`
4. Uninstall CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm uninstall -g @heygaia/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm remove -g @heygaia/cli
```

```bash bun
bun remove -g @heygaia/cli
```

</CodeGroup>

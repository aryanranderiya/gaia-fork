# GAIA on Slack

Use GAIA directly inside Slack — chat, manage todos, and run workflows from any channel or DM. The Slack bot runs via Socket Mode so no public URL or port forwarding is required.

## Getting Started (Users)

If the GAIA Slack app has been installed in your workspace, you can start using it immediately.

### 1. Link Your GAIA Account

```
/auth
```

You'll receive a link — click it, log in to your GAIA account, and your Slack identity will be connected.

### 2. Start Chatting

```
/gaia What should I focus on today?
```

You can also `@mention` GAIA in any channel it's been added to.

### Available Commands

#### Chat

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/gaia <message>` | Send a message to GAIA |

#### Todos

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/todo list` | Show all active todos |
| `/todo add <title>` | Create a new todo |
| `/todo complete <id>` | Mark a todo as done |
| `/todo delete <id>` | Delete a todo |

#### Workflows

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/workflow list` | List all your workflows |
| `/workflow get <id>` | View workflow details |
| `/workflow execute <id>` | Trigger a workflow manually |

#### Conversations & Utilities

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/conversations` | Browse your GAIA conversation history |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/status` | Check bot and API status |

### Notes

- All responses are **ephemeral** (only visible to you)
- Works in DMs and any channel the bot has been invited to
- Slash commands must be configured in the Slack app dashboard (see developer setup below)

## Developer Setup

This section is for developers who want to self-host the GAIA Slack bot.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A Slack workspace where you have **admin access**
- GAIA API running (see [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting/overview))

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App → From scratch**
3. Give your app a name and select your workspace

### Step 2: Enable Socket Mode

1. In the sidebar, go to **Socket Mode**
2. Toggle **Enable Socket Mode** on
3. Generate an **App-Level Token** with the `connections:write` scope
4. Copy the token — it starts with `xapp-`

### Step 3: Configure Bot Permissions

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add:
   - `chat:write`
   - `commands`
   - `im:history`
   - `im:read`
   - `im:write`
3. Click **Install App to Workspace**
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)
5. Copy the **Signing Secret** from **Basic Information**

### Step 4: Register Slash Commands

Go to **Slash Commands** and create each of these (Request URL can be blank in Socket Mode):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/gaia` | Chat with GAIA |
| `/auth` | Link your Slack account |
| `/workflow` | Manage workflows |
| `/todo` | Manage todos |
| `/conversations` | View conversations |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/status` | Check bot status |

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/bots/slack/`:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
GAIA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
GAIA_BOT_API_KEY=your_secure_bot_api_key
```

### Step 6: Start the Bot

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
nx dev bot-slack

# Production
nx build bot-slack && nx start bot-slack
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check Socket Mode is enabled and all tokens are correct |
| Command not found | Verify slash commands are created in the Slack app dashboard, then reinstall the app |
| Authentication fails | Ensure `GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` matches the API config |

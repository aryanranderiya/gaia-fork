# GAIA on Discord

Chat with your AI assistant, manage todos, and run workflows without leaving Discord. GAIA's Discord bot supports slash commands with autocomplete, DMs, and `@mention` responses in any channel.

## Getting Started (Users)

If someone has already set up the GAIA Discord bot in your server, you can start using it right away.

### 1. Link Your GAIA Account

Before using most commands, link your Discord account to GAIA:

```
/auth
```

You'll receive a link — click it, log in to your GAIA account, and your Discord identity will be connected automatically.

### 2. Start Chatting

```
/gaia What's on my schedule today?
```

Or simply mention the bot in any channel:

```
@GAIA Summarize my pending todos
```

You can also DM the bot directly — no mention needed.

### Available Commands

#### Chat

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/gaia <message>` | Send a message to GAIA |
| `@GAIA <message>` | Mention the bot in any channel |

#### Todos

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/todo list` | Show all active todos |
| `/todo add <title> [priority] [description]` | Create a todo (priority: low / medium / high) |
| `/todo complete <id>` | Mark a todo as done |
| `/todo delete <id>` | Delete a todo |

#### Workflows

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/workflow list` | List all your workflows |
| `/workflow get <id>` | View workflow details |
| `/workflow execute <id>` | Trigger a workflow manually |
| `/workflow create <name> <description>` | Create a new workflow |

#### Conversations & Utilities

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/conversations [page]` | Browse your GAIA conversation history |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/stop` | Stop the current response and start fresh |
| `/status` | Check if the bot and API are online |
| `/settings` | View your account settings |
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/unlink` | Disconnect your account from GAIA |

### Notes

- All slash command responses are **ephemeral** (only visible to you) by default
- Responses are streamed — a typing indicator appears while GAIA is thinking
- Long responses are automatically truncated to Discord's 2000 character limit
- `/workflow create` is Discord-only; other platforms support list/get/execute

## Developer Setup

This section is for developers who want to self-host the GAIA Discord bot.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A [Discord Developer Account](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- GAIA API running (see [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting/overview))

### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Navigate to the **Bot** section and click **Add Bot**
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - **Message Content Intent**
   - **Server Members Intent** (optional)
5. Copy the **Bot Token**

### Step 2: Configure OAuth2 Scopes

1. Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**
2. Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. Select bot permissions: **Send Messages**, **Use Slash Commands**, **Read Message History**
4. Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your server

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/bots/discord/`:

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
GAIA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
GAIA_BOT_API_KEY=your_secure_bot_api_key
```

`GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` must match the value configured in your GAIA API.

### Step 4: Deploy Slash Commands

Register the bot's slash commands with Discord:

```bash
nx run bot-discord:deploy-commands
```

This only needs to be run once (or whenever commands change).

### Step 5: Start the Bot

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
nx dev bot-discord

# Production
nx build bot-discord && nx start bot-discord
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Bot doesn't respond to commands | Run `nx run bot-discord:deploy-commands`, check bot permissions |
| Authentication link doesn't work | Verify `GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` matches API config |
| Bot offline | Check that the process is running and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is valid |

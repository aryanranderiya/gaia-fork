## Install the CLI

The GAIA CLI (`@heygaia/cli`) is a terminal-based tool for setting up, configuring, and managing GAIA instances.

**Global installation is recommended** to use the `gaia` command from anywhere in your terminal.

    The quickest way to install globally. Automatically detects your system and uses npm or bun. Installs Node.js if needed.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://heygaia.io/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="npm">
    Install globally using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @heygaia/cli
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="pnpm">
    Install globally using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm add -g @heygaia/cli
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="bun">
    Install globally using bun:

    ```bash
    bun add -g @heygaia/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify the `gaia` command is available:

```bash
gaia --version
gaia --help
```

<Tip>
If you get "command not found: gaia", ensure npm's global bin directory is in your PATH. See [Troubleshooting](/cli/commands#troubleshooting) for details.
</Tip>

## Alternative: Run Without Installing

You can run commands directly with `npx` without global installation, but this requires prefixing every command:

```bash
npx @heygaia/cli init
npx @heygaia/cli start
npx @heygaia/cli status
```

<Warning>
Using `npx` means you can't use the shorter `gaia` command. We recommend installing globally for the best experience.
</Warning>

## Requirements

- **macOS or Linux** (Windows via WSL2)
- **Docker** installed and running
- **Git** installed

The CLI will check for these prerequisites and guide you through installing anything missing.
